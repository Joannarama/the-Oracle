## Design
### Colour Scheme
  - The dark, night sky background evokes a sense of the mystical and supernatural, especially when juxtaposed with the images of the fortune teller and they crystal ball. 
  - The lighter shades of the buttons, text input box, error messages, fonts and imagery create contrast and improve visibility
  - the colours chosen for the elements are bright and fun
  - Opaity is intorduced to the background of the answer and horroscope text to improve readability without impacting the overall look and feel of the colour scheme and design. 
<!-- - Hex codes for colours: #c3fc95 (Light Green), #add8e6 (Light Blue), #ffffff (White), #000000 (Black) and #FFA500 (Orange) -->

### Backgrounds
  - The background of the night sky is uniform across it's area (without significant pattern) and is used consistently across all screen sizes. 

### Typography
  - The website has imported IBM Plex Serif and Lora into the HTMLS file from Google Fonts
  - The fonts are complimentary and easy for the user to read while in keeping with the overall look and feel of the website
  - The fallback font family is serif in both cases

  ### Future Development
<!-- any thoughts  -->

## Technologies Used
### Languages Used
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/projects) - code editor for the project used to write and update the code.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - used as version control software to maintain, upload and share code.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - used to import fonts to website
- [GoogleDev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) - was used to help investigate issues with code and visually see what code was related to which area on the page. The console function was also used for JavaScript


## Testing 
- the website was tested iteratively throughout the build, ensuring that all navigaation, interactive elements and responsiveness were working correctly. 

### HTML testing

- The HTML code was tested using the W3 code validator for HTML found at https://validator.w3.org/. The W3 validator found no errors. 

![HTML validator](assets/images/html_checker.JPG)

### CSS testing

- The CSS code was tested useing the WÂ£ code validator for CSS found at https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/. No errors were found. 

![css testing](assets/images/W3_css.JPG)


### Javascript testing

- The JavaScript code was tested using JsHint found at https://jshint.com/. No errors were found. The metrics were as follows:

  Metrics
  There are 6 functions in this file.

  Function with the largest signature take 2 arguments, while the median is 0.

  Largest function has 26 statements in it, while the median is 5.

  The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 7 while the median is 1.5.




### Browser and Device Testing
### Testing Responsiveness

The website was built "mobile first" and Chrome developer tools were used throughout the build to test for correct rendering on multiple screen sizes.

The website is tested for correct rendering and responsiveness and to ensure that all links and functionality work as expected on a number of viewport widths including:

- 320px
- 375px
- 768px
- 1140px

and on the following browsers:
- Chrome
- Safari
- Firefox
- Microsoft Edge





### Deployment

The following steps were taken to deploy the website to GitHub Pages: 

### **To deploy the project**
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy a site are as follows:
  1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the **Settings** tab.
  2. Once in Settings, navigate to the **Pages** tab on the left hand side.
  3. Under **Source**, select the branch to **main**, then click **save**.
  4. When step 3 was configured, every time I comitted and pushed code, github automatically deployed my updates to GitHub Pages.
