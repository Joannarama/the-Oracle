# PP2 - JavaScript Essentials - The Obfuscating Oracle

The Obfuscating Oracle is a fun interactive online game where the user poses 'closed' or Yes/No questions to 'The Oracle' who returns her sage, if sometimes silly, wisdom and future predictions via her crystal ball. 

To play the game, the user asks three questions and recieves their answers. Once the three questions have been asked, the user has the option to reveal their horoscope message from the Oracle. 

The inspiration for the game comes from a number of areas 
This is a fun, light-hearted interactive game for users of all ages intended to amuse and entertain a general audience.

  - The lighter shades of the buttons, text input box, error messages, fonts and imagery create contrast and improve visibility
  - the colours chosen for the elements are bright and fun
  - Opaity is intorduced to the background of the answer and horroscope text to improve readability without impacting the overall look and feel of the colour scheme and design. 
<!-- - Hex codes for colours: #c3fc95 (Light Green), #add8e6 (Light Blue), #ffffff (White), #000000 (Black) and #FFA500 (Orange) -->

### Backgrounds
  - The background of the night sky is uniform across it's area (without significant pattern) and is used consistently across all screen sizes. 

### Typography
  - The website has imported IBM Plex Serif and Lora into the HTMLS file from Google Fonts
  - The fonts are complimentary and easy for the user to read while in keeping with the overall look and feel of the website
  - The fallback font family is serif in both cases

## Browser and Device Testing
### Testing Responsiveness

The website was built "mobile first" and Chrome developer tools were used throughout the build to test for correct rendering on multiple screen sizes.

The website is tested for correct rendering and responsiveness and to ensure that all links and functionality work as expected on a number of viewport widths including:

- 320px
- 375px
- 768px
- 920 px
- 1140px
- 1024px

and on the following browsers:
- Chrome
- Safari
- Firefox
- Microsoft Edge



### Deployment

The following steps were taken to deploy the website to GitHub Pages: 

### **To deploy the project**
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy a site are as follows:
  1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the **Settings** tab.
  2. Once in Settings, navigate to the **Pages** tab on the left hand side.
  3. Under **Source**, select the branch to **main**, then click **save**.
  4. When step 3 was configured, every time I comitted and pushed code, github automatically deployed my updates to GitHub Pages.
