## Design
### Colour Scheme
- The dark, night sky background evokes a sense of the mystical and supernatural, especially when juxtaposed with the images of the fortune teller and they crystal ball. 
- The lighter shades of the buttons, text input box, error messages, fonts and imagery create contrast and improve visibility
- the colours chosen for the elements are bright and fun
- Opaity is intorduced to the background of the answer and horroscope text to improve readability without impacting the overall look and feel of the colour scheme and design. 
- Hex codes for colours: #c3fc95 (Light Green), #add8e6 (Light Blue), #ffffff (White), #000000 (Black) and #FFA500 (Orange)

### Backgrounds
 - The website uses cartoony style space backgrounds throughout to appeal to children and get them excited about the quiz
 - There are three different backgrounds in use for varying screen sizes

### Typography
- The website has imported IBM Plex Serif and Lora into the HTMLS file from Google Fonts
- The fonts are complimentary and easy for the user to read while in keeping with the overall look and feel of the website
- The fallback font family is serif in both cases 



## Features 
- __Header__
    ![Header](assets/images/header_ss.JPG)
  - The header for this game is very simple comprising the game title, 'The Obfuscating Oracle' and the 'How to Play' button clearly highlighted in a bright shade of purple. 

  __How to Play__
    ![rules](assets/images/rules.JPG)
   
  - From the landing page, the game rules may be obvious as the user is prompted to ask a question by typing in the text input field. However, the user may wish to gain a fuller understanding of the game play and click on 'How to Play' botton. 
  - On the 'How to Play' page the rules and steps of the games are concisely and clearly explained in 5 simple list items. 
  - On this page the 'How to Play' button is switched out for the 'Play Now' button, allowing the user to easliy navigate back to the game. 
  - This is the main section of the website which includes the game UI. It is responsive and includes the begin quiz, how to play and contact buttons
  

- __Gameplay Area__

  - As you enter the website, you are greeted with the quiz title and welcome text. This provides a quick overview of the theme of the quiz
  - The text has been written to appeal to children and is light hearted
  - The font styling has also been specifically chosen to appeal to children
  - The purpose of this section is to allow the user to navigate the game options easily across all devices without having to click through too many pages to get to their desired destination


  ![Title and Welcome Text](docs/feature-screenshots/title-and-welcome-text.png)

- __Begin Quiz Button__

  - The begin quiz button is the first button you see on the game menu and is in a prominent green colour to stand out
  - Once the user clicks the begin quiz button, this will take them to the questions and answers page to play the quiz

  ![Begin Quiz Button](docs/feature-screenshots/begin-quiz-button.png)

- __How To Play Button__

  - The how to play button is the next button you see in the game menu. This button is a pop-up modal which once clicked opens up a modal which contains the game rules
  - The pop-up modal is used for this button to minimise the amount of clicks the player has to make to be able to go back to the game menu screen and play the quiz

  ![How To Play Button](docs/feature-screenshots/how-to-play-button.png)

- __Contact Button and Form__ 

  - The contact button is the last button on the game menu and once clicked takes the player to a dedicated page which has a form on it
  - The form has been designed to be as short as possible, with only 3 fields to input (name, email and comments) and provides a way for the players to provide feedback
  - The form has box shadowing on it and a black border around the input fields to make them stand out
  - The form uses placeholder text to prompt the user to fill out the fields and provide them with an example of what should be inputted
  - The form uses JavaScript once a user has clicked the submit button to display their details and message they have just inputted below the submit button
  - This feedback is provided instead of an action URL being sent and also thanks the player for their message and informs them that a member of the team will get back to them shortly
  - There is a home button below the submit button to take the user back to the main menu

  ![Contact Button](docs/feature-screenshots/contact-button.png)

  ![Form](docs/feature-screenshots/form.png)

  ![Form JS Feedback](docs/feature-screenshots/form-js-feedback.png)

- __Main Quiz__
 -  The is the main quiz section that has all the questions and answers related to space
 - This part also contains the score, progress bar, countdown timer and question counter
 - It has been designed to be clear and intuitive
 - When a player clicks on an answer, it either turns green(correct) or red (incorrect) and then disables all other options so only one answer can be clicked per question
 - Each time an answer is chosen, a next button will appear to take the player onto the next question
 - If the countdown timer goes to 0 before all answers have been chosen, then a pop up message will be initiated displaying a better luck next time message. Once clicked, the answers and questions will disappear and be replace with a play again button. This will then lead to the quiz being reset once clicked

  ![Main Quiz](docs/feature-screenshots/main-quiz.png)

- __End Page For Quiz__
 - This is the section of the quiz that is displayed once the last question has been answered
 - It shows a congratulations message and dynamically inputs the score the user has achieved
 - It also displays a home and play again button

  ![End Page For Quiz](docs/feature-screenshots/end-quiz-page.png)

- __Question Counter__

  - The question counter provides a way for the player to know how many questions they have answered and what question they are on
  - It makes it easier for them to judge how much of the quiz they have completed and how much time they can spend on all the remaining questions
  
   ![Question Counter](docs/feature-screenshots/question-counter.png)

- __Progress Bar__
 
 - The progress bar is a visually appealing way to give quick snapshot of how far the player has progressed through the quiz
 - This compliments the question counter and they both go hand in hand 
 - The colour orange was chosen as it stands out and has good contrast compared to the other colours being used
 - The progress bar dynamically fills up after each question has been answered

   ![Progress Bar](docs/feature-screenshots/progress-bar.png)

- __Score__

  - The score system works on a one point per correct question basis
  - As you progress through the quiz the score is automatically updated in real-time as more and more correct questions are answered
  - A score feature was added to bring more interactivity, increase the fun element and encourage healthy competition

   ![Score](docs/feature-screenshots/score.png)

   - __Countdown Timer__

  - The question counter has been added to the main game quiz to add a bit more of a challenge element to the quiz and make it more enjoyable and rewarding to complete
  - It counts down in seconds and gives the user 60 seconds to complete each question 
  - The timer is automatically refreshed on each new question
  - If the user doesn't manage to complete an answer in time, an alert message will pop up and a play again and home button will be displayed
  - This will allow the player to either play again which resets the whole quiz or go to the home menu

  ![Countdown Timer](docs/feature-screenshots/countdown-timer.png)

  ![Try Again Screen](docs/feature-screenshots/try-again-screen.png)

  ### Future Development
- Currently the form doesn't POST the users data to anywhere as I've not learned how to do this yet. This is something I would like to develop in the future
- Create a high score table with the ability for the player to input their username which saves their individual scores
- Add audio feedback when questions are answered, using different sounds for correct or wrong answers
- Create multiple levels where the questions get harder the higher the level
- Create a resources page that provides lots more educational reading around the topic of space

## Testing 
- The main focus of the testing is on JavaScript, HTML and CSS as these are the three languages that were used to create the quiz and static web pages
- The testing carried out ensures that the functionality and visual aspects of the website all work as intended
- Testing will be done using numerous devices and browsers', ensuring all UX is to a high standard as well as testing the websites accessibility, SEO and validation
- I have checked the following:

  - The overall website navigational experience, ensuring the main quiz UI is easy to use, there's a clear logic flow to the menu and all pages can be accessed quickly
  - All internal links and modals work correctly
  - All forms are working as expected including script checks e.g. if a user fills in a mandatory field in a form an error message is shown, JS code runs correctly on the form and returns expected values, optimally formatted for better readability
  - All JS code is being executed without any errors; the main quiz game is working as it should be as well as all of its extra features
  - Contrast checks should report no errors
  - Validation checks for HTML and CSS should report no errors 
  - Lighthouse test scores should be high (within 90-100 range)


### Browser and Device Testing
__Browsers__
- I have tested the website across the four major browsers including Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari
- For each browser, functionality was tested including all quiz features that were built using JavaScript, and the responsive design
- The website performed as intended and the responsive design and quiz functions were checked using developer tools across multiple devices with structural integrity holding for the various sizes and no errors occurring

__Devices Tested__
The website was viewed on a variety of devices and screen sizes including:
- Windows 8.1 Desktop (screen resolutions tested in 2560x1080 and 1920x1080)
- Macbook Pro (13 inch 2015 version)
- Moto G4
- Galaxy S5

- Iphone 5/SE
- Iphone 6/7/8
- Iphone 6/7/8 Plus
- Iphone X
- Ipad
- Ipad Pro
- Surface Duo
- Nest Hub
- Nest Hub Max

A large amount of testing was done to ensure all features of the quiz worked correctly, buttons worked and forms submitted as intended. Family members and the Code Institute Slack community was asked to review the website to point out any bugs or user experience issues.

### W3C and JSHint Validators
The official W3C Markup Validator was used to validate both the HTML and CSS of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors within the site. The JSHint code quality checker was used to ensure no errors were present within the JavaScript code. The links to the results for each HTML page, CSS stylesheet and JavaScript script are below.

![Desktop Report](docs/testing-and-validation/lighthouse-audit-contact-page-desktop.png)

 - Mobile  
![Mobile Report](docs/testing-and-validation/lighthouse-audit-contact-page-mobile.png)

All pages have received a score no lower than 99 on all 4 categories of performance, accessibility, best practice and SEO showing it is well optimised. 

### Solved Bugs
1. The countdown timer text had a load delay when the begin quiz button was clicked. This offered poor user experience and as such needed to be fixed. This was achieved by adding the template literals code that was calling the timer text and countdown before the quizTimerRef set interval was called.
   - [Link to commit](https://github.com/Jbachtiger/ci-pp2-quizanaughts/commit/b56ce0e29d63bb2d16c5f7495e3a35269ea63a23)

2. The main quiz scoring component was out of sync with the end screen congratulations score that is dynamically pulled using a template literal. This only occurs when the player gets the last question right, meaning the template literal text is one point behind the main score text on the right of the quiz. To fix this the totalCorrectAnswersText variable that pulls the score was added to the endQuiz function to ensure the scores are pulled at the same time and match up.

3. An error occurred with the home button on the contact us page. After further investigation, it turns out the form element was used instead of a input element with a type attribute of button. The form tags were replaced with a single input tag with a button type. This fixed the error.
